	"disclaimer": "The author would like these rules to be respected when using the character:<br /><ul><li>NSFW/lewd is forbidden without specific permission.</li><li>Usage of the sprite and character in any work containing hate speech or inciting/encouraging hate against a group of people is forbidden.</li><li>Please keep her character more or less intact and keep the name \"Mio\". Changing her personality to some extent is fine (and I purposely kept the details vague), particularly if you're doing a meme mod or something where you change everything, but don't use the sprites for a different character. Using edits for OCs is fine, just please make it look like a different character, don't just change the hair color.</li></ul>Her profile:<br />Mio is an 18 year old third year student. While somewhat reserved, it's not out of shyness - she's just quite proper and ladylike. She tends to be a \"mom friend\" and frets about people around her. Before joining the Literature Club (or if she's not in the Literature Club) she was a member of her school's go club and is quite skilled at the game. (Competition being the one thing that brings out her less-than-ladylike side.)<br /><br />Her favorite books are classic Japanese literature, and she writes haiku. (Or otherwise short but evocative poems.)<br />Her words tend to relate to nature, Japanese culture, and \"classy\"/traditional things.",
