Say hello to Himari! Created by Prox#9492, Himari is (or once was) the vice president of the Debate Club.
Himari's literature interests coincide with her love of debate, since her focus is on the Greek Classics as well as the writings of Greek philosophers, especially Socrates, Plato and Aristotle.
Himari is 18 and, while a generally kind and friendly girl, also has a somwwhat naive nature, which she is working hard to overcome.
However, she might be going a bit too far in the opposite direction. 
You see, in the past, she was taken advantage of too many times, so if she feels as if she's being used or taken advantage of again, watch out. She has an extremely vindictive side.
She has a normal family and home life, though.
