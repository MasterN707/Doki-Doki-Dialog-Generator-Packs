He likes sarcasm and joking about people (including himself). He's caring. He's so much caring, that he can be hostile towards any bulli, which may make him just a little bit edgy and maybe a little bit annoying. *IMPORTANT* His greeting is \"Hello there\", so when making any CD, don't mistake it with anything else :P. Oh, I almost forgot, he lost his parents.</p><p>Now some rules:</p><ul><li>He shall NEVER be rude (he can tease tho, just don't make him an asshole) to any of the Dokis besides other MC's</li><li>No NSFW CD's, unless they are jokes</li><li>If you want to use him as a character other than MetalMC, please ask for permission on reddit: u/PrezesBocianow, or change his hair and eyes color</li><li>I have nothing against you giving him some new outfits or expressions hehe</li></ul><p>Oh, and it would be appreciated if you could ping me in the comments, I'd love to see your work :P</p>",

Changing her personality to some extent is fine (and I purposely kept the details vague), particularly if you're doing a meme mod or something where you change everything, but don't use the sprites for a different character. Using edits for OCs is fine, just please make it look like a different character, don't just change the hair color.</li></ul>Her profile:<br />Mio is an 18 year old third year student. While somewhat reserved, it's not out of shyness - she's just quite proper and ladylike. She tends to be a \"mom friend\" and frets about people around her. Before joining the Literature Club (or if she's not in the Literature Club) she was a member of her school's go club and is quite skilled at the game. (Competition being the one thing that brings out her less-than-ladylike side.)<br /><br />Her favorite books are classic Japanese literature, and she writes haiku. (Or otherwise short but evocative poems.)<br />Her words tend to relate to nature, Japanese culture, and \"classy\"/traditional things.",

		"description": "I don't want to put any limits on you, so I'll let you change whatever you want, but I'll be happy if you stick to my concept of her personality<br /><br />Nastya, 18<br /><br />She used to go to a music club, but left because of an early disagreement with the club president, At this point she can't count extra classes, but is thinking about joining any club.<br />At the music club she honed her guitar skills, which she learned before joining the club.<br /><br /><br />Personality: She is milancholic and prone to stressful situations and depression, but she tries not to show it in public and pretends to be \"calm and all right\", but is not always the case, which can be noted when her hands shake during stressful situations or is under the influence of others. Most often, she can not refuse someone in any request, even if it would be to the detriment of themselves. It is very difficult for Nastya to admit that she cannot do what is placed on her shoulders, so she tries with all her might to at least pretend that she is doing her job. She likes to communicate with people, but it's much easier for her to do it on the Internet than in real life. You can often see messages from her on any social network, for example in Rine (invented) - analog of Line messenger, which is popular in Japan in IRL. She also likes physical intimacy, such as being hugged or stroked by her hair. Sometimes she may give or say something cringe or shitpost. She can occasionally be very vulgar and blunt as well, and may bring up sensitive topics in conversation<br /><br />Hobbies: She likes to play acoustic guitar and wants to try playing electric guitar someday, despite her melancholic nature she likes listening to music such as rock and punk rock, besides music she studies programming she understands that it is difficult for her, but she does not want to quit because even if she does not understand it, she likes to do it, besides music and programming she likes to read some books or watch TV series, anime or movies. <br /><br /><br />Likes: listening to music (she'll sometimes just put on her headphones in class and listen to music while ignoring everything around her), reading, playing the guitar, and cooking.<br />She'll watch anything that catches her interests and enjoys drawing, even if she's not very good at it. Loves sweets.<br />Favorite bands are: \"king of jesters\" (invented) - Based on real band \"King and Jester\" and twenty two pilots (invented)<br />Dislikes: does not like modern music and prefers music that was written in the 90s or in the 2000s. She does not like children because of their constant yelling and inadequate behavior.<br /><br /><br />background: Her background I leave completely to you, but please take into account only one detail; namely that her father is from Russia and that her mother is from Japan, which explains her name",
